 ## Overview
 My team and I developed a 4 DOF (Degrees of Freedom) robot arm car using Arduino technology, designed for precise object manipulation and autonomous movement. We assembled it from various pieces and programmed it to feature four joints, allowing it to execute complex pick-and-place tasks with precision. The Arduino microcontroller controls the motors and servos, enabling smooth and stable movement across a plane while ensuring balance during operation.

 ## Main features
 - **Pick and Place:** Capable of picking and placing objects with precision, controlled via a mobile phone or game controller.

- **Learning Sequences:** Can learn and record sequences of movements to repeat specific actions automatically, enhancing its automation capabilities.

- **Auto Carry:** Designed to autonomously carry objects from one location to another.

- **Obstacle Avoidance:** Equipped with sensors to detect and avoid obstacles during movement, ensuring safe operation.

- **Follow Functionality:** Capable of following a designated path or user-defined route, improving usability in various scenarios.
## Learning outcomes
- **Robotic Kinematics:** Gained a solid understanding of robotic kinematics, including the movement and positioning of joints and arms, which is essential for precise object manipulation.

- **Motor Control:**  Developed hands-on experience in controlling motors and servos using Arduino technology, enhancing skills in hardware programming.

- **Programming Skills:** Improved coding proficiency in Arduino programming, enabling the integration of various components and functionalities into the robot.

- **Automation Techniques:** Learned how to implement automation features, such as recording and repeating sequences of movements, contributing to a better understanding of autonomous systems.

- **Sensor Integration:** Gained experience in integrating sensors for obstacle detection and navigation, enhancing the robot's ability to operate safely and effectively in dynamic environments.

- **Problem-Solving:** Enhanced problem-solving abilities through troubleshooting and optimizing the robot's performance during the design and testing phases.

- **Team Collaboration:** Fostered teamwork and collaboration skills while working with peers to design, assemble, and program the robot arm car.
